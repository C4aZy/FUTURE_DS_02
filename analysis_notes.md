## Key Metrics Used
- Impressions
- Total Spend
- Clicks
- Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- Approved Conversions
- Return on Investment (ROI)

## Key Insights
- **Campaign 936** is the most efficient campaign, delivering the highest CTR and a strong positive ROI.
- **Campaign 1178** generated the highest number of conversions but at a high cost, resulting in a negative ROI.
- Overall CTR is low (≈0.015%), indicating weak engagement despite high impressions.
- Higher spend does not always translate to better ROI, as seen in the spend vs. conversions comparison.

## Best Performing Campaign

  - Strong positive ROI
  - Best balance between spend and approved conversions

## Underperforming Campaign
- **Campaign 1178**

## Limitations
- Audience demographics and ad creative details were not available.

- Conversion quality beyond approval status is unknown.

## Recommendations

- Improve ad creatives and messaging to increase CTR.
- Test narrower and more targeted audience segments.
